# Oops Development TODO

## Project Status: Core Integration Phase

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Phases

### Phase 0: Project Foundation (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Monorepo setup with TypeScript, Jest, ESLint
- ‚úÖ Basic package structure (CLI + Core)
- ‚úÖ Core classes with placeholder functionality
- ‚úÖ CLI framework with basic commands
- ‚úÖ Test suite configured and passing

### Phase 1: Git Command Structure (COMPLETED)
**Objective**: Transform CLI to Git-compatible commands with comprehensive testing

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1a**: Documentation Update - Updated all docs to reflect Git command structure
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1b**: Command Restructure - Replaced 5-command with 8-command Git-compatible structure
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1c**: CLI Parser Update - Updated argument parsing for new command patterns
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1d**: Implementation - Created all 8 commands with placeholder functionality
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1e**: Testing - Achieved ~85% CLI coverage with 100% utils coverage

**Results**: 
- ‚úÖ CLI uses Git commands: `track`, `commit`, `checkout`, `log`, `diff`, `untrack`, `keep`, `undo`
- ‚úÖ Git options supported: `--oneline`, `--graph`, `--tool`
- ‚úÖ Complete lifecycle management (track ‚Üí version ‚Üí navigate ‚Üí end)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite with 110+ test cases
- ‚úÖ All commands build and execute without errors
- ‚úÖ Git-style output formatting implemented

**Test Coverage Analysis**:
- CLI Package: ~85% coverage (commands.test.ts, cli.test.ts, utils.test.ts)
- Utils Package: 100% coverage (OutputFormatter, PromptManager)
- Integration Tests: Complete workflow testing implemented
- Edge Cases: Comprehensive error handling tested

## üîß Current Phase

### Phase 2: Core Integration (IN PROGRESS)
**Objective**: Connect CLI commands to actual Core package functionality

**Critical Gap Identified**: CLI commands currently use placeholder implementations. Need to integrate with Core package for real functionality.

#### Phase 2a: CLI-Core Connection (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Import and instantiate Oops core class in CLI commands
- ‚úÖ Replace placeholder console.log statements with core.track(), core.commit(), etc.
- ‚úÖ Implement proper error handling from core operations
- ‚úÖ Update command validation to use core state checking
- ‚úÖ Test real end-to-end workflows with core integration

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ All 8 CLI commands now use real Core package functionality
- ‚úÖ TrackCommand: Uses core.track() and workspace auto-initialization
- ‚úÖ CommitCommand: Uses core.keep() + re-track for version simulation
- ‚úÖ StatusCommand: Uses core.getAllTrackedFiles() and change detection
- ‚úÖ DiffCommand: Uses core.diff() and core.hasChanges()
- ‚úÖ LogCommand: Uses tracking info for basic version history
- ‚úÖ CheckoutCommand: Uses backup restoration for limited version navigation
- ‚úÖ UntrackCommand: Uses core.abort() to stop tracking
- ‚úÖ UndoCommand: Uses core.undo() to restore and stop tracking
- ‚úÖ Manual testing confirms real file operations work correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test suite needs updates for new integrated behavior

#### Phase 2b: Version System Implementation (PENDING)
- ‚è≥ Implement real version numbering (1.0 ‚Üí 1.1 ‚Üí 1.2)
- ‚è≥ Add branching logic (1.1 ‚Üí 1.1.1, 1.1.2 when editing past versions)
- ‚è≥ Create version tag system compatible with Git
- ‚è≥ Implement auto-increment logic for complex versioning
- ‚è≥ Replace backup/restore model with version tracking

#### Phase 2c: State Management Integration (PENDING)
- ‚è≥ Implement state tracking (untracked, tracked-clean, tracked-dirty, past-version)
- ‚è≥ Add command validation based on current file state
- ‚è≥ Implement smart error messages with helpful suggestions
- ‚è≥ Create state transition logic for commands

- **CRITICAL**: No version numbering system implemented (using backup/restore simulation)
- **CRITICAL**: Version navigation limited to 1.0/backup restoration only
- **CRITICAL**: Commit workflow uses keep+re-track instead of proper versioning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Technical Debt**: Simple-git dependency needs migration to isomorphic-git
- **Architecture**: Workspace-based storage needs redesign for per-file repos
- **Enhancement**: Help command handling needs improvement
- **Enhancement**: External diff tool integration incomplete

### üìã IDENTIFIED GAPS
- Core package has 0% test coverage
- No integration between CLI and Core packages
