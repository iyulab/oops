# Oops Development TODO

This document tracks the implementation roadmap for Oops - a CLI tool for safe text file editing with automatic backup and simple undo.

## 📋 Phase Management Guidelines

### Phase Structure
Each development phase follows a consistent structure:
- **Phase Goal**: Clear objective and deliverables
- **Sub-phases**: Weekly or bi-weekly sprints with specific tasks
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes that define completion
- **Duration**: Estimated time to complete

### Phase Completion Process
**Every phase must end with a documentation update step:**

1. **Complete Phase Deliverables** - Finish all technical tasks
2. **Update Documentation** - Final phase step (mandatory)
   - Update `docs/TODO.md` with completed phase status
   - Update `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` with current state
   - Update `CLAUDE.md` with implementation notes
   - Create phase summary and lessons learned
3. **Next Phase Planning** - Reorganize and refine upcoming phases
   - Reassess priorities based on completed work
   - Adjust timelines and scope based on actual progress
   - Break down next phase into detailed weekly tasks
   - Update success criteria and metrics
