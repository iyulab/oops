# Oops Development TODO - Updated for Actual Implementation State

## Project Status: Identity Resolution Phase

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Project has two parallel implementations with conflicting philosophies. Need immediate architectural decision and alignment.

---

## 🚨 URGENT: Architecture Decision Required

### Current State (2025-01-13)

**Two Competing Implementations Coexist:**

1. **Simple CLI** (`simple-cli.ts`) - Core Purpose Aligned
   - ✅ 5 essential commands: `oops <file>`, `status`, `diff`, `keep`, `undo`
   - ✅ Simple backup/restore workflow (no versioning)
   - ✅ Fully functional with comprehensive tests
   - ✅ Matches documented project purpose

2. **Complex CLI** (`cli.ts`) - Git-Inspired Versioning
   - ✅ 9 Git commands: `track`, `commit`, `checkout`, `log`, `diff`, etc.
   - ✅ Full version management system (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.1.1)
   - ✅ Complete Git-style workflow
   - ❗ **Currently set as main binary** in package.json

**Problem**: Documentation describes simple backup system, but complex CLI is the default interface.

### ✅ What's Actually Working (All Tests Passing: 155/155)

#### Core Package (`@iyulab/oops`)
- ✅ **SimpleBackup Class**: Complete simple backup/restore system
- ✅ **Oops SDK**: Full versioning system with Git integration
- ✅ **FileSystem**: Complete filesystem abstraction
- ✅ **GitWrapper**: Working Git integration via simple-git
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error system with atomic operations
- ✅ **Transaction System**: Safe atomic file operations
- ✅ **Configuration**: Environment-based config management

#### CLI Package (`@iyulab/oops-cli`)
- ✅ **SimpleCLI**: 5-command interface (matches docs)
- ✅ **CLI**: Complex Git-compatible interface
- ✅ **Utilities**: Output formatting, prompt management
- ✅ **Integration**: Both CLIs work with Core functionality

#### Test Suite
- ✅ **100% Core Coverage**: All core functionality tested
- ✅ **Complete CLI Coverage**: Both simple and complex interfaces tested
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows verified
- ✅ **Safety Tests**: Atomic operations, error handling, edge cases

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE DECISION REQUIRED

Choose project direction and resolve architectural conflict:

### Option A: Simple Backup Tool (Align with Documentation)
**Change Required:**
- Make `simple-cli.ts` the main binary
- Archive complex CLI implementation
- Focus on 5-command simplicity
- Update any docs that mention Git commands

**Pros:**
- Matches documented purpose
- Zero learning curve
- Simple, focused tool
- Clear project identity

### Option B: Git-Style Versioning Tool (Expand Documentation) 
**Change Required:**
- Update documentation to describe Git capabilities
- Keep complex CLI as main interface
- Rebrand as "Git for single files"
- Update README with versioning examples

**Pros:**
- More powerful functionality
- Appeals to developers familiar with Git
- Unique positioning in market
- Leverages existing complex implementation

## 🧪 TDD Strategy

### Test-First Development Approach

#### 1. Behavior Tests (What user experiences)
```typescript
describe('User Workflow', () => {
  it('should track file and create backup')
  it('should show changes clearly')
  it('should restore safely')
  it('should handle errors gracefully')
})
```

#### 2. Integration Tests (CLI + Core interaction)
```typescript
describe('CLI Integration', () => {
  it('should work end-to-end with real files')
  it('should handle concurrent operations')
  it('should maintain atomic safety')
})
```

#### 3. Performance Tests (Non-functional requirements)
```typescript
describe('Performance', () => {
  it('should handle files up to 10MB')
  it('should complete operations in <1 second')
  it('should work with 100+ versions')
})
```

### Current Test Status
- ✅ **155 tests passing** across all functionality
- ✅ **Core SDK**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Both CLIs**: Complete workflow testing
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Error handling, atomic operations, unicode files
- ✅ **Safety**: File corruption, permission errors, cleanup
