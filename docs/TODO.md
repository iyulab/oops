   - ✅ Complete Git-style workflow with linear progression
   - ✅ Set as main binary in package.json
   - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage and functionality

**Architecture Decision**: Git-style versioning system chosen as primary interface.
**Simple backup functionality** moved to archive for reference.

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTION CHOSEN

**Decision Made**: Git-style versioning system selected as primary interface.

### Current Architecture: Git-Style Single File Versioning

**Implementation Approach:**
- ✅ Git-compatible commands with familiar syntax
- ✅ Simple linear version progression (1→2→3→4)
- ✅ Standard Git output formats for tool compatibility
- ✅ Single file focus with isolated version histories
- ✅ Hidden Git infrastructure for reliability

**Key Benefits:**
- Familiar command syntax for Git users
- Powerful version management without complexity
- Standard tool compatibility (diff viewers, etc.)
- Reliable Git-based storage engine

## 🧪 TDD Strategy

### Test-First Development Approach

#### 1. Behavior Tests (What user experiences)
```typescript
describe('User Workflow', () => {
  it('should track file and create backup')
  it('should show changes clearly')
  it('should restore safely')
  it('should handle errors gracefully')
})
```

#### 2. Integration Tests (CLI + Core interaction)
```typescript
describe('CLI Integration', () => {
  it('should work end-to-end with real files')
  it('should handle concurrent operations')
  it('should maintain atomic safety')
})
```

#### 3. Performance Tests (Non-functional requirements)
```typescript
describe('Performance', () => {
  it('should handle files up to 10MB')
  it('should complete operations in <1 second')
  it('should work with 100+ versions')
})
```

### Current Test Status
- ✅ **Comprehensive test coverage** across all functionality
- ✅ **Core SDK**: Complete unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Version System**: Full workflow testing (track→commit→checkout→diff→log)
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Error handling, atomic operations, unicode files
- ✅ **Safety**: File corruption, permission errors, cleanup operations
