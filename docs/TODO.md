## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 0: Project Foundation (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Monorepo setup with TypeScript, Jest, ESLint
- ✅ Basic package structure (CLI + Core)
- ✅ Core classes with placeholder functionality
- ✅ CLI framework with basic commands
- ✅ Test suite configured and passing

### Phase 1: Git Command Structure (COMPLETED)
**Objective**: Transform CLI to Git-compatible commands with comprehensive testing

- ✅ **Phase 1a**: Documentation Update - Updated all docs to reflect Git command structure
- ✅ **Phase 1b**: Command Restructure - Replaced 5-command with 8-command Git-compatible structure
- ✅ **Phase 1c**: CLI Parser Update - Updated argument parsing for new command patterns
- ✅ **Phase 1d**: Implementation - Created all 8 commands with placeholder functionality
- ✅ **Phase 1e**: Testing - Achieved ~85% CLI coverage with 100% utils coverage

**Results**: 
- ✅ CLI uses Git commands: `track`, `commit`, `checkout`, `log`, `diff`, `untrack`, `keep`, `undo`
- ✅ Git options supported: `--oneline`, `--graph`, `--tool`
- ✅ Complete lifecycle management (track → version → navigate → end)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 110+ test cases
- ✅ All commands build and execute without errors
- ✅ Git-style output formatting implemented

**Test Coverage Analysis**:
- CLI Package: ~85% coverage (commands.test.ts, cli.test.ts, utils.test.ts)
- Utils Package: 100% coverage (OutputFormatter, PromptManager)
- Integration Tests: Complete workflow testing implemented
- Edge Cases: Comprehensive error handling tested

## 🔧 Current Phase

### Phase 2: Core Integration (IN PROGRESS)
**Objective**: Connect CLI commands to actual Core package functionality

**Critical Gap Identified**: CLI commands currently use placeholder implementations. Need to integrate with Core package for real functionality.

#### Phase 2a: CLI-Core Connection (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Import and instantiate Oops core class in CLI commands
- ✅ Replace placeholder console.log statements with core.track(), core.commit(), etc.
- ✅ Implement proper error handling from core operations
- ✅ Update command validation to use core state checking
- ✅ Test real end-to-end workflows with core integration

**Results**:
- ✅ All 8 CLI commands now use real Core package functionality
- ✅ TrackCommand: Uses core.track() and workspace auto-initialization
- ✅ CommitCommand: Uses core.keep() + re-track for version simulation
- ✅ StatusCommand: Uses core.getAllTrackedFiles() and change detection
- ✅ DiffCommand: Uses core.diff() and core.hasChanges()
- ✅ LogCommand: Uses tracking info for basic version history
- ✅ CheckoutCommand: Uses backup restoration for limited version navigation
- ✅ UntrackCommand: Uses core.abort() to stop tracking
- ✅ UndoCommand: Uses core.undo() to restore and stop tracking
- ✅ Manual testing confirms real file operations work correctly
- ⚠️ Test suite needs updates for new integrated behavior

#### Phase 2b: Version System Implementation (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implement real version numbering (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2)
- ✅ Add branching logic foundation (1.1 → 1.1.1, 1.1.2 when editing past versions)
- ✅ Create version tag system compatible with Git
- ✅ Implement auto-increment logic for sequential versioning
- ✅ Replace backup/restore model with version tracking
- ✅ Create VersionManager class for complete version control
- ✅ Implement version history, diff, and checkout functionality

**Results**:
- ✅ New VersionManager class with complete version control system
- ✅ CLI commands updated to use real version numbering (track → 1.0, commit → 1.1, 1.2...)
- ✅ Version history with timestamps, messages, and checksums
- ✅ Checkout functionality for navigating between versions
- ✅ Diff support between any two versions
- ✅ Git-compatible version output formatting
- ✅ All 8 CLI commands integrated with new version system

#### Phase 2c: State Management Integration (PENDING)
- ⏳ Implement state tracking (untracked, tracked-clean, tracked-dirty, past-version)
- ⏳ Add command validation based on current file state
- ⏳ Implement smart error messages with helpful suggestions
- ⏳ Create state transition logic for commands
